# Better Warden Hints
Adds color to the subtitles which help indicate how angry the warden is toward a player.

## How it works
The warden works on an anger mechanic to determine when to spawn and who to target, each player is assigned an anger value which can range from 0 to 4.

Each time a player triggers a shrieker this value increments by 1 and 1 of 4 sounds are played depending on the wardens anger state toward a player, each of the 4 sounds has its own subtitle and as a result can be modified via a resource pack.

This particular resource packs changes the 4 different sound subtitles to have a color which helps indicate to the player how angry the warden is toward them.

## Language support
No modifications have been made to existing entries but as with some languages not being 100% complete, I had to place some en_US entries where there were none. As of now, that wont pose as an issue, but in the future when these languages become more complete, this pack will overwrite the changes mojang make.
